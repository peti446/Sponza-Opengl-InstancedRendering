# Draw My Sponza

An exercise to draw a complete 3d scene using OpenGL 3.3 for my graphics
programming students.

## Getting Started

### Obtaining

The project can be obtained from the git repository located at
https://bitbucket.org/Tees3GP/DrawMySponza.git, for example:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/Tees3GP/DrawMySponza.git
```

### What's Included

```
DrawMySponza/
|-- DrawMySponza/
|   |-- assets/
|   |-- doc/
|   |-- shaders/
|   |-- source
|-- sponza/
|-- tgl/
|-- tygra/
```

The root directory contains the Visual Studio solution tying the sub-projects
together.

The `DrawMySponza` directory contains the necessary project configuration
files.

The `assets` sub-directory contains runtime data files required by the app
(e.g. texture image files).

The `doc` sub- directory contains any documentation or configuration files for
redistribution to users.

The `shaders` sub-directory contains the runtime shaders files for
redistribution with the app to users.

The `source` sub-directory contains the source code (including any private
headers) for the project.

The `sponza` directory contains a sub-project to expose the Sponza environment
to the programmer.

The `tgl` directory contains a sub-project to handle exposing OpenGL function
prototypes based upon desired OpenGL version.

The `tygra` directory contains a sub-project to provide OpenGL window
management and utility file operations.

### Using

The project is designed to be used within Visual Studio producing an
executable.

The project will build into a directory structure under a `build` sub-directory
in the solution directory.

For ease, all projects in the solution are using the tdk configuration files.
If you add additional sub-projects, easily embed them by copying `tdk.props`
and `tdk.targets` into the new project directories and include the following
at the appropriate location in their `vcxproj` files:

```
<Import Project="tdk.props" />
<Import Project="tdk.targets" />
```

DrawMySponza is dependent upon the following libraries:

* TGL: available from https://bitbucket.org/tpdavison/tgl

* TyGrA: available from https://bitbucket.org/tpdavison/tygra

* GLFW3: available from http://www.glfw.org/

* GLM: available from https://github.com/g-truc/glm

* TCF: available from https://scma-intranet.tees.ac.uk/users/u0018196/tdk/tcf.zip

* TDL: available from https://scma-intranet.tees.ac.uk/users/u0018196/tdk/tdl.zip

* TSL: available from https://scma-intranet.tees.ac.uk/users/u0018196/tdk/tsl.zip

* Sponza: available from https://scma-intranet.tees.ac.uk/users/u0018196/tdk/sponza.zip

* NvToolsExt (optional): available as part of NSIGHT (https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-nsight-visual-studio-edition)

TGL, TyGrA and Sponza are expected to be a side-along project in the parent
solution.  The other library files should be added into the appropriate
location in the following directory structure under the parent solution
directory.

```
external\
|-- bin\
|   |-- Win32\
|   |-- x64\
|-- doc\
|-- include\
|   |-- GLFW\
|   |-- glm\
|   |-- tcf\
|   |-- tdl\
|   |-- tsl\
|-- lib\
|   |-- Win32\
|   |-- x64\
|-- res\
```

Dynamic library files (DLLs) should be placed in the appropriate sub-directory
of the `bin` directory.  Runtime resource files should be placed in the `res`
directory.
